# 🏦 Loan Default Risk Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes borrower data to identify high-risk customer segments that are more likely to default on loans. The objective is to support data-driven lending decisions and reduce overall credit risk.

The dashboard provides insights into demographic and financial factors that influence loan default behavior.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Which customer segments are most likely to default on loans, and how can lending decisions be optimized to reduce credit risk?

---

## 💼 Business Context

Loan defaults increase non-performing assets (NPAs), reduce profitability, and expose financial institutions to credit risk. Banks must balance growth with risk by identifying high-risk borrowers and optimizing approval strategies.

This project uses structured loan data to segment borrowers and detect patterns associated with default probability.
